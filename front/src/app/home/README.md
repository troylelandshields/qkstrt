#View

home.tpl.html is responsible for showing our Buttons to the user. From here, you can add a button and click on existing buttons. 

This file interacts with only the controller, which lives in home.js.

#Controller

home.js defines the controller for our simple app. It exposes some functionality to home.tpl.html for getting our Buttons, clicking them, and and adding new ones.

It uses a service called 'buttonsSvc' that allows the controller to send requests to our backend to perform these actions.

#Model

Our service is defined in rest.js. This is where our model comes from and where we send requests to our backend.

In this service, we are using the Google API client that is generated by our backend, but we should be able to completely replace this service that makes requests to a different backend without having to alter the Controller or View at all.
